        <h2>Eligibility and Account Responsibilities</h2>
        <p>
            To use certain features of Blokmap, including making reservations and submitting
            content, you must create an account and be at least 13 years old.
        </p>
        <p>
            Each user may have only one account. However, it is possible to link multiple identity
            providers (IDPs) to a single account for convenience. Some locations may impose
            restrictions based on which IDP a user has linked.
        </p>
        <p>
            You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account credentials,
            including your password. You must notify Blokmap immediately if you suspect any
            unauthorized use of your account.
        </p>

        <h2>Service Description and User Obligations</h2>
        <p>
            Blokmap provides a platform to discover and reserve study and work locations, and allows
            location owners and institutions to manage their spaces. While we encourage location
            owners to keep information accurate and up-to-date, Blokmap cannot guarantee that all
            location details are completely correct at all times.
        </p>
        <p>
            Users are expected to submit accurate and truthful information when adding or editing
            locations, reviews, or other content. Users must behave respectfully while using
            locations and must not use Blokmap for any illegal or unauthorized purposes. Failure to
            comply with these obligations may result in suspension or termination of your account.
        </p>

        <h2>Content Ownership and License</h2>
        <p>
            Users retain ownership of the content they submit to Blokmap, including reviews,
            location descriptions, and images. By submitting content, you grant Blokmap a worldwide,
            non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use, display, distribute, and modify that content
            as necessary to provide and improve the platform and its services.
        </p>
        <p>
            This license allows Blokmap to show your content to other users, include it in platform
            features, and make minor adjustments such as formatting or resizing images. You remain
            responsible for the content you submit and must ensure it does not violate any laws or
            third-party rights.
        </p>

        <h2>Reservations and Payments</h2>
        <p>
            Users can make reservations for locations through Blokmap. Reservation details,
            including time and location, are stored within your account. You may cancel or modify
            reservations through the platform according to the general process provided; Blokmap
            does not guarantee availability of any location at a given time.
        </p>
        <p>
            Payments for services or premium features offered through Blokmap are handled entirely
            by Mollie, our payment provider. Blokmap does not store any payment details, except for
            order IDs and the minimal information required to link payments to user accounts. Users
            are responsible for providing accurate payment information to Mollie and complying with
            Mollie's terms and conditions.
        </p>

        <h2>Prohibited Activities</h2>
        <p>
            Users must not engage in any activities that violate laws or the rights of others. This
            includes, but is not limited to, fraudulent activity, harassment or abuse of other
            users, submitting false or misleading information, reverse engineering or scraping the
            platform, and any illegal or unauthorized use of Blokmap.
        </p>

        <h2>Liability and Disclaimers</h2>
        <p>
            Blokmap strives to provide accurate, reliable, and up-to-date information and to
            maintain the platform in good working order. We make every reasonable effort to ensure
            that reservations, location details, and other features function correctly.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, despite these efforts, errors or omissions may occur, and unforeseen issues can
            arise. Blokmap cannot be held responsible for any damages or losses resulting from the
            use of the platform, including incorrect location information, reservation conflicts, or
            third-party actions, except in cases of proven negligence on our part.
        </p>
        <p>
            The platform and its services are provided "as is" and without warranties of any kind
            beyond what is explicitly stated in these Terms and Conditions.
        </p>

        <h2>Termination and Suspension</h2>
        <p>
            Blokmap reserves the right to suspend or terminate user accounts at any time if a user
            violates these Terms and Conditions or engages in prohibited activities. Accounts may be
            suspended or deleted without prior notice in such cases.
        </p>
        <p>
            Users may also terminate their own accounts at any time. Upon account termination,
            personal data will be deleted or anonymised in accordance with the Privacy Policy.
        </p>

        <h2>Modifications to the Terms</h2>
        <p>
            Blokmap may update these Terms and Conditions from time to time. The most current
            version will always be available on this page. By continuing to use the platform, you
            agree to be bound by the updated terms.
        </p>

        <h2>Governing Law and Jurisdiction</h2>
        <p>
            These Terms and Conditions are governed by the laws of Belgium. Any disputes arising
            from or in connection with these terms shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of
